<!-- badges: end -->

mitre package is designed to provide easy access to cybersecurity data standards.
You can expect functions to get data frames for every standard object.
It provide a directed graph with all relationships for deep exploratory analysis.
You could avoid full parsing process using the latest public Rdata sets.

## Installation

You can install the released version of mitre from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("mitre")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("motherhack3r/mitre")
```
## Basic usage

This is a basic example which shows you how to view shield tactics ids and names:

```{r example}
library(mitre)
mitredata <- mitre::getLatestDataSet()
shield <- mitredata$standards$shield
shield$tactics[, c("id", "name")]
```
This example shows the number of ATT&CK Techniques by domain:

```{r example2}
table(mitredata$standards$attck$techniques$domain)
```


## Network visualization

This is a example which shows you how to visualize shield network:

```{r example3}
# library(visNetwork)
# g <- visNetwork::visNetwork(nodes = shield$shieldnet$nodes,
#                             edges = shield$shieldnet$edges)
# g
```

## Advanced exploratory analysis
Check [this](https://datadrivensecurity-project.web.app/) proof of concept project. It is a Rmarkdown document performing an exploratory analysis with mitre network and [this data set](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/attckr/tree/master/inst/extdat).

 - [Exploratory analysis](https://github.com/Barbero95/DataDrivenSecurity-Project): developed by [barbero95](https://github.com/Barbero95) and [marta](https://github.com/martavilab). 
 - Sample incidents data set from rpackage [attckr](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/attckr/tree/master/inst/extdat) developed by [Bob Rudis](https://github.com/hrbrmstr).
