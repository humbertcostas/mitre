mitre package is designed to provide easy access to cybersecurity data
standards. You can expect functions to get data frames for every
standard object. It provide a directed graph with all relationships for
deep exploratory analysis. You could avoid full parsing process using
the latest public Rdata sets.

## Installation

You can install the released version of mitre from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("mitre")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("motherhack3r/mitre")
```

## Basic usage

This is a basic example which shows you how to view shield tactics ids
and names:

``` r
library(mitre)
mitredata <- mitre::getLatestDataSet()
shield <- mitredata$standards$shield
shield$tactics[, c("id", "name")]
#>        id       name
#> 1 DTA0001    Channel
#> 2 DTA0002    Collect
#> 3 DTA0003    Contain
#> 4 DTA0004     Detect
#> 5 DTA0005    Disrupt
#> 6 DTA0006 Facilitate
#> 7 DTA0007 Legitimize
#> 8 DTA0008       Test
```

This example shows the number of ATT&CK Techniques by domain:

``` r
table(mitredata$standards$attck$techniques$domain)
#> 
#> enterprise-attack        ics-attack     mobile-attack        pre-attack 
#>               670                81               104               174
```

## Network visualization

This is a example which shows you how to visualize shield network:

``` r
# library(visNetwork)
# g <- visNetwork::visNetwork(nodes = shield$shieldnet$nodes,
#                             edges = shield$shieldnet$edges)
# g
```

## Advanced exploratory analysis

Check [this](https://datadrivensecurity-project.web.app/) proof of
concept project. It is a Rmarkdown document performing an exploratory
analysis with mitre network and [this data
set](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/attckr/tree/master/inst/extdat).
