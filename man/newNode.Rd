newNode()

\value{
data.frame
}
\description{
\code{id} : The id of the node unique value for all standard elements.
\code{label} : The label is the piece of text shown in or under the node, depending on the shape.
\code{group} : When not undefined, the group of node(s)
\code{type} : Used as subgroup to classify different object from
\code{value} : When a value is set, the nodes will be scaled using the options in the scaling object defined above.
\code{title} : Title to be displayed when the user hovers over the node. The title can be an HTML element or a string containing plain text or HTML.
\code{standard} : The id of the standard
\code{shape} : The shape defines what the node looks like. The types with the label inside of it are: ellipse, circle, database, box, text. The ones with the label outside of it are: image, circularImage, diamond, dot, star, triangle, triangleDown, square and icon.
\code{color} : Color for the node.
\code{hidden} : When true, the node will not be shown. It will still be part of the physics simulation though!
\code{mass} : Default to 1. The "barnesHut" physics model (which is enabled by default) is based on an inverted gravity model. By increasing the mass of a node, you increase it's repulsion. Values lower than 1 are not recommended.
\code{description} : Description could include extra information or nested data which include other columns from original data frame observation.
